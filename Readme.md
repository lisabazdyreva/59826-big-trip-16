# Big Trip learning project

### Interface description

Web application for planning a trip. You can add a trip point with city, dates and type. Also you can edit information or remove the trip point. 

For all point types are available different additional offers. Every offer has a price, which is taken into account for a total price (right top in menu). Also the information about starting and finishing trip cities and dates are placed in left top in menu. All this information is updating when you edit or remove points.

In Big Trip are available sorting and filtering. You can sort points by date, price and duration. Filtering is about past or future events.

Also implemented the charts, which provide information like in sorting in user-friendly interface.
