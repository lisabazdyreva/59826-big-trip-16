# Big Trip learning project

### Interface description

Web app for planning a trip. You can add a trip point with city, dates and type. Also you can edit information or remove the point. 

For all point types are available different additional offers. Every of offer has a price, which is taken into account for a total price (right top in menu). Also an information about starting and finishing trip cities and dates are placed in left top in menu. All this information is updating, when you edit or remove points.

In Big Trip are available sorting and filtering points. You can sort points by date, price and duration. Filtering is about past or future events.

Also implemented the charts, which provide information like in sorting in user-friendly interface. 

### Stack description

- I develop this app in pure Javascipt(es8) in OOP-style. 
- Webpack is used for assembly. 
- For charts and choosing dates I used chart.js and flatpickr libraries.

Requests to server and catching errors were implemented.
